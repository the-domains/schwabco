I think that would make it easier for me to reflect about what I always dreamed programming would be. </p><p>As a kid I saw my self as an avid “Star Trek — The Next Generation” fan. And I still am — even though the original show is long off the screens. In particular, I remember I felt inspired by one of the Enterprise’s unsung heroes: the ship’s Computer. The all-powerful Enterprise Computer had very little it couldn’t do (other than in cases where it advanced the plot). One would basically talk to the computer — and it just do the thing it was suppose to do. As a kid in the late 80's, my slim experience with computers already taught me that we were a long way from living in the Star Trek future. </p><p>My first actual attempt at programming was with a language called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_%28programming_language%29" data-href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_%28programming_language%29">Logo</a>. We were already taught about the “Turtle” — a flickering green triangle on a monochrome screen —  that didn’t look like any turtle I’ve ever seen (granted, I was 6, but still — that did <strong>not</strong> look like a turtle). I was disappointed to learn all we ended up doing was what seemed to me like a very complicated way of drawing squares and circles. Little did I know, that was the foundation for understanding how programs work, and that I would revisit these paradigms 24 years later.</p><p>By the time I was 9, I already got my first VGA screen, and a brand new Intel 80386 computer, complete with a 4X (!) CD-ROM drive. Now I could take control over my very own Enterprise, Hear Indiana Jones  speak for the first time, and I could finally enjoy Simon’s snarky comments with a proper British accent. Of course, all this fun couldn’t last forever — my Mom has decided I was spending too much of my time on mindless games. Knowing I wouldn’t go down without a fight, she decided to harness my obsession for games for educational purposes: she gave me my first real programming tool ever: Klik & Play.</p><p>The thing about Klik & Play that kept me coming back was how easy it was to work with. I could pretty much reason about most games I built, because there was almost no background knowledge required. The program came in a big white box, with a thick, detailed instruction book. Step by step, I learned about conditionals, about loops and functions — without really learning any syntax of any particular language. Of course, I didn’t know it at the time — I didn’t even really think about <strong>how</strong> it worked, only that it did. </p><p>As time passed, I learned more about my computer, and about other programming languages. But there was one language that dominated over all others: Visual Basic. It reminded me of the KnP interface — You create things on the screen, and they do things. The code I had to plug into the various components of the page was almost like a black box to me. I understood parts of it, but mostly it was no more than 2–3 lines of code, making the component do very simple things. </p><p>From that point on, I was obsessed with programing — but things kept becoming harder and harder for me to understand on my own. I kept using Visual Basic for my own pet projects, but tried my best to learn about C++ and Java. None of those really took — I felt like the task was too daunting. I basically stopped programming altogether by the time I joined the army, and didn’t program again until 4 years later. </p><h4>Innocence Lost</h4><p>After the break I took from programming, I came back through the farthest thing from visual language imaginable — Bash. From that point on, I learned the languages everybody else was using around me — and with every new language, I dove into a world of dependencies, ever growing complexities and functional hierarchies. The full scale of what it meant to build a meaningful computer program made me feel like I was only getting farther and farther from the Star Trek fantasy. </p><p>My first big Bash program extracted information from lines of logs, and created sanitized data for reports I built with Excel. Thinking back on it, Excel started as my main programming tool, using the very useful suite of built-in, (like VLOOKUP and others) — building layers of ever shrinking data sets represented on different sheets, each sheet with it’s own set of responsibilities. With Bash, I learned how to parse text, and how to apply logic to my process. My love affair with Bash didn’t last very long. I was trying to build more sophisticated reports, and having my programming mojo partially back, it was time to move on. </p><p>For next couple of years I used Perl and PHP interchangeably. Mostly for building internal reporting tools, but I was really looking at becoming a Web Master. I started diving into PHP frameworks, and discovered Drupal, Wordpress, and later on CodeIgniter and Symphony.</p></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-black colors-global " data-reactid="14"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="15"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="16"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="17"><span data-reactid="18"><!-- react-empty: 19 --><h2 data-reactid="20"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="21">Programming and Me</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="22"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="23"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="24"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
